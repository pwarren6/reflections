What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you use 'git init' command, you create and initialize an empty .git repository.
The reason you would need to do this is for whenever you want to start a new document,
start a new project, muck around with some code, etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the respoitory?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary field primarily used to bundle changed files into commits.
In terms of value, it brings connectivity between the working directory and the repository.
Without the staging area, there would be no way to commit more than
one file to the respotiroy; i.e., it would had to have been done
one file per commit at a time.
