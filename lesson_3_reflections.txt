When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I feel using a remote repository aside from keeping work local is essential for
when you want to update to the remote repository from your local computer, or when someone wants to commit to your project from theirs.
By using a remote repository, it makes projects made within a group of developers much easier than doing it locally.
