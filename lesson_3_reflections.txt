When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I feel using a remote repository aside from keeping work local is essential for
when you want to update to the remote repository from your local computer, or when someone wants to commit to your project from theirs.
By using a remote repository, it makes projects made within a group of developers much easier than doing it locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

While having automatic, up-to-date pulls with the remote repository sounds better,
there are some drawbacks. One drawback would be doing pulls on an interval, but there
isn't anything to pull from the repository, i.e. there have been no commits. Doing pulls
manually helps to get you into the habit of making pulls from your repository to keep
your local data the same as on your GitHub repository.
